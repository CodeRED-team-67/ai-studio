// FIX: Replaced placeholder content with a valid, empty service implementation.
// This service is for interacting with the Mathpix API.
// It is not currently used in the application but is available for future features
// that might involve processing mathematical notations from course materials.

// Environment variables for Mathpix API credentials would be needed.
// const APP_ID = process.env.MATHPIX_APP_ID;
// const APP_KEY = process.env.MATHPIX_APP_KEY;

// Example function placeholder
export const processImageWithMathpix = async (imageUrl: string) => {
    console.log('Mathpix service called for image:', imageUrl);
    // Implementation would involve making a POST request to the Mathpix API
    // with the image URL and API credentials.
    return {
        text: 'This is a placeholder response from Mathpix service.',
    };
};
